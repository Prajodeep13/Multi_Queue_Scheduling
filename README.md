# 🧠 Multi-Level Queue Scheduling Simulator with Gantt Chart

A Python-based simulation of Multi-Level Queue (MLQ) CPU scheduling algorithms with **Gantt chart visualization** using `matplotlib`.

This project demonstrates how an operating system handles processes using **multiple scheduling queues**, each with a different strategy like **Round Robin**, **FCFS**, and **SJF**.
